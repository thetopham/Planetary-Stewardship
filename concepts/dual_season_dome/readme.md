## Concept Overview

**Dual-Season Domes** are paired, climate-controlled ecosystems that invert the local weather.  
When the outside world freezes, visitors step into spring.  
When summer scorches, they enter a world of snow.

Together, they form a **bi-seasonal sanctuary** — a living thermostat for human emotion, wellness, and play.

> *A collaboration between nature, technology, and emotion.*

## Experience Storyboard

### Scene 1 — *Outside the Winter Wind*
A gray February morning. A glowing glass dome rises from the snow, misted and golden within.

> “When winter lingers, we bring you spring.”

### Scene 2 — *Inside the Spring Dome*
Sunlight cascades through the canopy.  
People wander barefoot, laptops on laps, birds singing overhead.

**Features:**
- 72°F / 22°C microclimate  
- Botanical forest and natural pools  
- Circadian LED “sun”  
- Hydroponic air-purifying gardens

> “I don’t want to leave. It’s like my body forgot how gray I felt.”

### Scene 3 — *Inside the Winter Dome*
A breath of crisp, alpine air. Snow crunches. People sip cocoa while watching artificial snow fall.

**Features:**
- 35°F / 2°C controlled climate  
- Ice caverns, snow hills, cold therapy pools  
- Nordic Café & meditative silence zones

> “Fifteen minutes inside and I feel clear again.”

## Architecture & Engineering

| System | Function |
|--------|-----------|
| **Twin-Dome Thermal Exchange Loop** | Transfers waste heat between domes, minimizing energy use. |
| **ETFE Smart Membrane** | Adjustable transparency and heat regulation. |
| **AI Climate Control** | Predictive sensors balance humidity, temperature, and CO₂. |
| **Hydroponic Biofilters** | Natural air purification from living systems. |
| **Solar-Thermal Integration** | Offsets heating cost during cold months. |

## Market Model

| Segment | Value Proposition |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Locals** | Year-round wellness and recreation escape. |
| **Tourists** | Iconic, photogenic attraction with guaranteed weather. |
| **Corporate** | Retreats, offsites, climate-controlled venues. |
| **Health & Education** | Climate therapy, botany labs, sustainability exhibits. |

**Revenue Streams**
- Entry passes & memberships  
- Onsite cafés and co-working rentals  
- Seasonal festivals (“Midwinter Bloom”, “Summer Frost”)  
- Energy partnership via heat exchange credits

## Vision for the Future

Phase 1: **Pilot Dome Pair — Boulder, Colorado**  
Phase 2: **Franchise Model — Nordic & Desert Cities**  
Phase 3: **Global Network — Planetary Comfort Grid**

> “One day, humanity could live anywhere — poles, deserts, space — and always feel at home.”

---

## Energy Model (Summary)

The Dual-Season Domes utilize a **Thermal Exchange Loop** between paired environments.  
The heat extracted from the winter dome directly warms the spring dome, achieving up to 35% energy savings compared to traditional HVAC systems.

- **Solar arrays** supplement the spring dome’s energy needs.  
- **Geothermal wells** stabilize temperature differentials.  
- **Phase-change storage tanks** retain excess energy for off-peak use.

This circular system makes the complex nearly self-sustaining.
